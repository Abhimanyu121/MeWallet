#MobiEthPay

##Description
The current process of using Ethereum and crypto is a very cumbersome one. The users need to write long mnemonic or manage private keys for their wallets. For a non-technical user, this is a scary process. This hinders the mass adoption of Ethereum and this won't be fixable until there is a solution where the users don't have to deal with this all the technical blockchain related stuff and just focus on sharing assets. One of the most famous and familiar way to do this is to use mobile numbers. In a lot of countries, the users are familiar with chatting, calling and even sending fiat using the mobile number. So, our projects aim at solving this problem and make the mass adoption of Ethereum and Blockchain in general possible through simplified user experience and yet keeping the privacy and anonymity of users.

##What did we use?
We used flutter to develop the application, web3dart to interact with the chain and nuChypher to mantain the anonymity the users over the network and identity off the network.
