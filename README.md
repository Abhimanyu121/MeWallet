## Our Vision
###### Making cryptocurrencies  accessible to all

## The Problem
The current process of using Ethereum and crypto is a very cumbersome one. The users need to write long mnemonic or manage private keys for their wallets. For a non-technical user, this is a scary process. This hinders the mass adoption of Ethereum and this won't be fixable until there is a solution where the users don't have to deal with this all the technical blockchain related stuff and just focus on sharing assets.
## Our Solution
One of the most famous way to transfer fiat currency using mobile numbers. In a lot of countries, the users are familiar with chatting, calling and even sending fiat using the mobile number. So, our projects aim at solving this problem and make the mass adoption of Ethereum and Blockchain in general possible through simplified user experience and yet keeping the privacy and anonymity of users. Our projects allows users to send crypto currencies to other users of same application using only the mobile numbers and not the scary looking(to layman) ethereum addresses. Our platform aims to mantain complete privacy of the users over the ledger with complete encryption o fphone numbers over the ledger and transacion details will be end to end encrypted.
